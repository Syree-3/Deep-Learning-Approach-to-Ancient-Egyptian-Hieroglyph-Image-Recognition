# Deep Learning Approach to Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyph Image Recognition

In this project, we will explore the ability of different convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify pictures of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. This project contains 4210 manually annotated images of Egyptian hieroglyphs found in the Pyramid of Unas and is also available to download from here.

Gardiner's Sign List is considered a standard reference in the study of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. The goal is to train an image classifier to recognize different hieroglyphs and predict their Gardiner labels:

S29	M17	X1	G43
s29	m17	x1	g43
In this project we will only use a fraction of the dataset to train:

Convolutional Neural Network from scratch
The last few layers of VGG16 Neural Network with a few additional layers (transfer learning)
