# Deep Learning Approach to Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyph Image Recognition

In this project, we explored the ability of different convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify pictures of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. This project contains 4210 manually annotated images of Egyptian hieroglyphs found in the Pyramid of Unas.

Gardiner's Sign List is considered a standard reference in the study of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. The goal was to train an image classifier to recognise different hieroglyphs and predict their Gardiner labels:

S29	M17	X1	G43
s29	m17	x1	g43

Only a fraction of the dataset was used to train the Convolutional Neural Network.
